## üîç **RAG Implementation**

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation** system that:
1. Stores user stories as vector embeddings
2. Retrieves relevant context for queries
3. Generates personalized Bangla/Banglish responses

![RAG Architecture Diagram](Images/deepseek_mermaid_20250628_d30019.png)  
*Figure 1: RAG System Workflow*

### **Key Components**
| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Embedding Model | Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | Text-to-vector conversion |
| Vector Database | MongoDB Atlas | Fast semantic search |
| LLM | Groq (Llama-3-70b) | Context-aware generation |

### **Data Flow**
![RAG Data Flow Diagram](Images/deepseek_mermaid_20250627_32e9a5.png)  
*Figure 2: End-to-End Data Pipeline*

### **Why This Works**
- üí° **Bangla-Optimized**: Handles code-mixing (Banglish) effectively
- üîê **Private**: Each user only accesses their own stories
- ‚ö° **Fast**: Groq's LPU enables <1s responses
- üß† **Accurate**: Vector search finds relevant story segments
